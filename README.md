##How to Use
You need Ruby 1.9.3+ and [bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler).

In Terminal, install bundler with 
```
gem install bundler
```
Then, run 
```bundle install```

Next, rename `options-example.yaml` to `options.yaml`, and `ranks-example.yaml` to `ranks.yaml`.<br>

Add your credentials in `options.yaml`. Finally, in Terminal, run 
```
ruby app.rb
```
